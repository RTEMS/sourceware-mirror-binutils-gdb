     This is also used to work around a difference between the way gold
     generates .gdb_index version <=7 and the way gdb does.  Arguably this
     is a gold bug.  For symbols coming from TUs, gold records in the index
     the CU that includes the TU instead of the TU itself.  This breaks
     dw2_lookup_symbol: It assumes that if the index says symbol X lives
     in CU/TU Y, then one need only expand Y and a subsequent lookup in Y
     will find X.  Alas TUs live in their own symtab, so after expanding CU Y
     we need to look in TU Z to find X.  Fortunately, this is akin to
     DW_TAG_imported_unit, so we just use the same mechanism: For
     .gdb_index version <=7 this also records the TUs that the CU referred
     to.  Concurrently with this change gdb was modified to emit version 8
     indices so we only pay a price for gold generated indices.

/* Start a subfile for DWARF.  FILENAME is the name of the file and
   DIRNAME the name of the source directory which contains FILENAME
   or NULL if not known.
   This routine tries to keep line numbers from identical absolute and
   relative file names in a common subfile.

   Using the `list' example from the GDB testsuite, which resides in
   /srcdir and compiling it with Irix6.2 cc in /compdir using a filename
   of /srcdir/list0.c yields the following debugging information for list0.c:

   DW_AT_name:          /srcdir/list0.c
   DW_AT_comp_dir:      /compdir
   files.files[0].name: list0.h
   files.files[0].dir:  /srcdir
   files.files[1].name: list0.c
   files.files[1].dir:  /srcdir

   The line number information for list0.c has to end up in a single
   subfile, so that `break /srcdir/list0.c:1' works as expected.
   start_subfile will ensure that this happens provided that we pass the
   concatenation of files.files[1].dir and files.files[1].name as the
   subfile's name.  */
