/* This file contains a library that can be preloaded into GDB on Linux
   using the LD_PRELOAD technique.

   The library intercepts calls to OPEN, CLOSE, READ, and PREAD in order to
   fake the inode number of a shared memory mapping.

   When GDB creates a core file (e.g. with the 'gcore' command), then
   shared memory mappings should be included in the generated core file.

   The 'id' for the shared memory mapping shares the inode slot in the
   /proc/PID/smaps file, which is what GDB consults to decide which
   mappings should be included in the core file.

   It is possible for a shared memory mapping to have an 'id' of zero.

   At one point there was a bug in GDB where mappings with an inode of zero
   would not be included in the generated core file.  This meant that most
   shared memory mappings would be included in the generated core file,
   but, if a shared memory mapping happened to get an 'id' of zero, then,
   because this would appear as a zero inode in the smaps file, this shared
   memory mapping would be excluded from the generated core file.

   This preload library spots when GDB opens a /proc/PID/smaps file and
   immediately copies the contents of this file into an internal buffer.
   The buffer is then scanned looking for a shared memory mapping, and, if
   a shared memory mapping is found, its 'id' (in the inode position) is
   changed to zero.

   Calls to read/pread are intercepted, and attempts to read from the smaps
   file are then served from the modified buffer contents.

   The close calls are monitored and, when the smaps file is closed, the
   internal buffer is released.

   This works with GDB (currently) because the requirements for access to
   the smaps file are pretty simple.  GDB opens the file and grabs the
   entire contents with a single pread call and a large buffer.  There's no
   seeking within the file or anything like that.

   The intention is that this library is preloaded into a GDB session which
   is then used to start an inferior and generate a core file.  GDB will
   then see the zero inode for the shared memory mapping and should, if the
   bug is correctly fixed, still add the shared memory mapping to the
   generated core file.  */
