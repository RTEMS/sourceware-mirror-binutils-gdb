#  - TEST_NAME is the name of the test, used to differentiate the binaries.
#  - LINES_VERSION is the version of the version of the .debug_line section to
#    generate.
#  - DW_AT_NAME is the string to put in the compilation unit's DW_AT_name
#    attribute.
#  - MAIN_FILE_IDX is the file index the .debug_line and .debug_macro sections
#    will use to refer to the main file.
#  - DIRECTORIES is a list of directories to put in the .debug_line section
#    header
#  - FILE_NAMES is a list of {name, directory index} pairs describing the files
#    names to put in the .debug_line section header.
