# Test setting a breakpoint on a kernel symbol without debug info,
# relying on minimal symbols from the ELF.

# A bug occured when GDB did not find the appropriate architecture for
# breakpoints on minimal symbols. This had the effect that the
# breakpoint would not be hit on the GPU when no debugging infos are
# available.
